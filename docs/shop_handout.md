# Shop Handout (Treasure Hunt Partner)

**What this is:** A short, $1-per-player treasure hunt that brings players into your shop to find a small envelope/token. You get foot traffic and a shout-out.

**Time window:** Hunts run in a short window (e.g., 60–90 minutes). We remove any leftover envelopes immediately after.

**Your part (minimal effort):**
- Allow a small envelope/token to be placed in a public, non-intrusive spot (near a poster, endcap, counter sign, etc.).
- If a player brings the envelope or code to checkout, congratulate them and hand over the small prize (we supply or reimburse).
- If staff are busy, you can simply verify the code and let the organizer deliver the prize later.

**Organizer provides:**
- Prizes (or covers cost if you provide an item).
- Clear rules for players (respectful behavior, no purchase required).
- Public thank-you/shout-out for your shop after the hunt.

**Why participate:**
- Quick burst of foot traffic and local buzz.
- Positive social posts thanking your shop.
- No long-term commitment; you can opt in or out per hunt.
