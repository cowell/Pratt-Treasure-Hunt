# Hunt Setup Checklist (Physical Prize Hunts)

Use this list before every hunt to keep it smooth and fair.

## 24–48 hours before
- Pick 1–2 prizes and their value.
- Choose 3–6 clue locations and get permission from each shop.
- Draft clues that require being on-site (sign text, plaque year, menu price, color, object).
- Generate a **unique code** for this hunt’s envelope/token.
- Publish the date/time window and price ($1), plus basic rules.
- Prepare a simple payment link (PayPal/Stripe/Square) and a link to the clue sheet.

## Day-of (before start)
- Print/prepare envelopes or tokens with the unique code inside.
- Place envelopes in agreed safe/public spots; confirm with staff.
- Confirm submission/contact method (e.g., Google Form or “show code at checkout”).
- Have a message ready for “prize claimed” updates.

## During the hunt
- Post “Hunt is live” at start time; share the clue link.
- Monitor for the first correct find; update “prize claimed” when it’s found.
- Be reachable (text/DM) for shops and players.

## After the hunt (same day)
- Announce winner(s) and thank participating shops.
- Remove any leftover envelopes/tokens.
- Log lessons: which clues worked, any confusion, foot traffic feedback.
- Tease the next hunt date/theme to keep momentum.
