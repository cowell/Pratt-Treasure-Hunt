# Player Rules (Treasure Hunt)

Simple, fair, and fun for everyone.

1. **Price:** $1 per player per hunt (unless stated otherwise).
2. **Time window:** Hunts run only during the posted time (e.g., 60–90 minutes). Starts at the announced time; early scouting doesn’t help.
3. **Prizes:** 1–2 prizes per hunt. First person to physically find the prize envelope/token wins. One prize per person per hunt.
4. **How to win:** Follow the clues, find the hidden envelope/token, and show the code to the shop checkout (or organizer) to claim.
5. **Respect locations:** Stay in public/shop-approved areas. Don’t block aisles or disturb staff/customers. No purchase is required to play.
6. **Honesty:** Don’t move, damage, or hide clues/envelopes. If something is missing, contact the organizer immediately.
7. **Safety:** Obey traffic laws, watch for cars, and be aware of your surroundings.
8. **Conduct:** Be polite to shop staff and other players. The organizer can disqualify anyone who breaks rules or behaves disrespectfully.
9. **Tie-breaks:** If multiple people arrive together, the first to present the envelope/token or correct code wins.
10. **Updates:** Organizer may post live updates if an envelope is claimed—check the announcement channel/page.
